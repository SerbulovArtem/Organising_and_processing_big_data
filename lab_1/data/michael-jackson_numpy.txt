[Spoken Intro:]
You ever want something
that you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it,
The more you want it
And then one day you get it,
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh...
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know, I know,
I know, know, know, know, know,
I know, I know,
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
[Chorus:]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are
[Bridge:]
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
[Chorus:]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are
Oooh
Foolish of me, I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
You've been so true
I've been so cruel to you
Oh, girl please don't leave me
[Chorus:]
If you stay I'll find a way
To erase the past
Baby don't leave me
Girl don't take your love from me
Oh girl
What can I say to make you stay
Baby, don't leave me
You've been so kind
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you
[Chorus:]
Tell me girl, it's not to late
And you give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl don't take your love
Don't take your love
[Bridge:]
Girl, if you take your love away from me
I'm gonna be in misery
Your love is the strength that I lean upon
How will I make it when it's gone
Of all the little things I wanted to say....
...I really wanted to do
Girl , this time...
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it
[Chorus:]
So tell me girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Don't take your love, no no no no no
Don't take your love
Don't leave me girl
Don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me
Don't take your love from me
Oooh, don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me
[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today...
In our small way
Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share
[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today...
In our small way
In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough
[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today...
In our small way
Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need
[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today...
In our small way
Got to be there, got to be there
In the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there, got to be there
Bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl
Oh what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize
I need her sharing her world beside me
So I've got to be there
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she is my girl
When she says, "Hello world!"
I need her sharing the world beside me
That's why I've got to be there
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me, she's home
Got to be there
Got to be there
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
[Chorus:]
Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go
[Chorus]
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet
[Chorus]
When this old world gets you down
When your spirit's on the ground
Just remember I will always be around
Just climb on the wings of my love
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
When you're feeling all alone
Like a child who's got no home
You know you've always got a place where you can go
Just climb on the wings of my love
Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine
'Til you break those ties that bind
'Til that day you're really mine
Anytime you want to leave your world behind
Just climb on the wings of my love
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine
We've got rainbows yet to find
And we'll find them all in time
Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love
Anytime you want to leave your world behind
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love
Yes remember I will always be around
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

If you're on that lonely night
What's my life without you girl
I'm so lonely I'm so blue
Without you darling my life is through
Come on back
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tendeness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the lonelyness
Thar was waiting there
[Spoken:]
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away
[Spoken:]
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now
Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
[Spoken:]
My heart cries out for your tuch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone
When you're down and trubled
And you need some love and care
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I'll be there to brighten up
Yeah, even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-runnin'
To see you again
[Chorus:]
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah I will
You've got a friend
When the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind
He begins to blow
Here's what you do baby
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
And soon you'll hear me
Knockin' at your door
Oh yes I will, yes I will
You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-runnin'
To see you again
[Chorus]
Ain't it good to know
That you've got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, don't let them
[Chorus:]
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right till the end, for you
Ain't it good to know
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)
Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben
Love is like a circus and a carnival is beautiful to see

With A Child's Heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child's heart
Turn each problem into play
No need to worry no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown
Love is as welcome
As a sunny sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy nice and easy
Like a child so gay and so carefree
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me down
Into each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed my side
You make the sun shine
[Refrain]
I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down

He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time
[Refrain]
I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you
You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some day my happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some, some, some, some, day
My happy arms will hold you
And some day I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I, till you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now)
Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Till now
Happy, yeah yeah
Happy, oehoe happy
happy oh yeah Happy
[fade out]
They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all
They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all

We'll be present at the birth
Of all faith looking new
Morning glow is long past due
Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago
Morning glow all days long
For we sing tomorrow's song
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow is almost here
Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago
Morning glow all of your life
We can make the new day right
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last
We've been together for such a long time now
Music, music and me
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme
Now music, music and me
Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me
Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony
Birds of a feather will fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me
No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges
Can turn us around
Cause what we're searchin' for
Will soon be found
[Refrain]
Cause we're almost there
Just one more step
(Cause we're almost there)
Just one more step
(Just one more step)
Don't give up
'Cause we're almost all almost there
('Cause we're almost there)
(Look at the lovers)
Look at the lonely lovers
That didn't make it
Life's long hard climb
(Life's long hard climb)
They just couldn't take it
(They just couldn't take it)
Don't let it happen to me and you
Hold on together, darlin'
We'll make it through
Darlin', keep on reachin' out for me
Keep on reachin, do it for me
Do it for me, cause baby
[Refrain]
('Cause we're almost there)
(We're almost there)
('Cause we're almost there)
We're so close
I can taste it
A life so sweet
Can't afford to waste it
(Can't afford to waste it)
Need to feel your hand
Slippin' from mine?
Just hold on tighter now, darlin'
Keep on tryin'
[Refrain]
Baby, do it for me, do it do it baby
(Cause we're almost there)
Just one more step
(We're almost there)
Don't give up
(Cause we're almost there)
Just one more step
Baby baby, don't give up
('Cause we're almost there)
Keep on, keep on
(We're almost there)
Just one more step
('Cause we're almost there)
Cause we're almost there
[Instrumental]
Juste one more step
Cause we're almost there
We've come to far
To turn around
Ooh!!
Keep on reachin'
For higher ground
We've had our ups and we've had our downs
Let nothin' in the world darlin'
Turn us around
Cause we're almost there
We're almost there
We're almost there
Everything we're lookin' for
We're almost there
Keep on reachin' out for me
Cause we're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there
Ah we're almost there
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
I thought the grass was green on the other side
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again
I want you to...
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you
In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and...
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
I'm on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the prolems that I caused you
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me
One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll . . .
One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day . . .
One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day . . .
One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there
[VERSE 1]
Cinderella, stay awhile

How lucky we are to be me and you

I Wouldn't Help It, No
[Repeat To Fade]
[1st Verse]
You're Not Like Anybody I Ever Knew
But That Don't Mean That I Don't Know Where We Are
And Though I Find Myself Attracted To You
This Time I'm Trying Not To Go Too Far, Cause
[Bridge]
No Matter How It Starts It Ends The Same
Someone's Always Doing Someone More
Trading In The Passion For That Taste Of Pain
It's Only Gonna Happen Again
[Chorus]
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
All Night... All Night
[2nd Verse (Patti Austin)]
And Though I'm Trying Not To Look In Your Eyes
Each Time I Do They Kind Of Burn Right Through Me
Don't Want To Lay Down In A Bed Full Of Lies
And Yet My Heart Is Saying Come And Do Me
[Bridge (Michael)]
Now We're Just A Web Of Mystery
A Possibility Of More To Come
I'd Rather Leave The Fantasy Of What Might Be
But Here I Go Falling Again
[Chorus]
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
Over You... Over You (All Night)
[Chorus]
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
All Night... All Night

[Fade-Out/Repeat]
[Verse 1:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed
[Chorus:]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
[Verse 2:]
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin'up behind
You're out of time
[Chorus:]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting to survive inside a killer, thriller tonight
[Bridge:]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life
[Verse 3:]
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All thru the night I'll save you from the terrors on the screen,
I'll make you see
[Chorus:]
That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
[Rap - Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnite hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighbourhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
Can you dig it?!
[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here.
Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear."
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it [4x]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
[Chorus 2x]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
[Chorus 3x]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it
[1st verse]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
[2nd verse]
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
[3rd verse]
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(do think twice.)
[4th verse]
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
She showed a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby
[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night)
Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away
So let me keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love

Just come into my arms
While the world goes spinnin' by
In the glow of candlelight
I will show you you're the lady in my life
Don't need no fortune or fame
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
No time for castles in space
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)
I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
As long as I know you'll be there, girl
So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life
Lay back in my tenderness

Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy

And baby through the years even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day

She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me.
Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
Don't let it get you down
When you're not on top
Where else numbers two
Let gets up and never stops, no
Ain't double same, loving me bring me game
Don't let it get you down, oh no
Don't let it get you down
When the cards are wrong
Pick up and let them walked away
Before you loose your heart
(Don't regret, girl)
Ain't double same, loving me bring me game
Don't let it get you down
(Oh, no)
Oh, no
Don't get mean
Don't it seem like you know what I'm talking about
Don't get me
Let me be the one to straighten it out, girl
(Don't let it get you down, oh no, don't let it)
(Don't let it get you down, oh no, don't let it)
Ain't double same
Loving me bring me game
Don't let it get you down
I can make you sunshine, make you happy
Ain't no clouds sky came out number me, yeah
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
You can start again
Now yesterday is gone
Let tomorrow be your friend
(Don't regret, girl)
Hey, don't regret girl,
Mama is still ahead
Don't let it get you down,
(Oh, no)
Oh no

I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost and passed away
I felt my destiny were sad the rain
Going know her way
There's sound of the melody
I got song you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Make my heart keep turn
To the music got to love that filled my mind
Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only
Oh, oh
(I see you love me)
The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
But when you lend my mind
Have an answer now love don't hold me
All the girls have bringhten now
And the darkness is lighter now
Is my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye you today
Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only
Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know there's music to my ears
Every word that you say
Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only
If I had a penny for everytime
I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel for everytime
I didn't understand
I'd be the world poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you're willing do
If I had only reach out
I might still be touching you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
(You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you)
Would get embarrassed for every time
I've moved and make you cry
You get sentimental, and
I would never know the reason why
I hold the world sings
Making for my selfish pride
Is it really over
When I get close to you
I only want to show you
That I'm learning a thing or two
If you want the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to...
Girl you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah
It's no dreams
But with proof as sweet as you, noo
Apples peaches and cherries
Just won't do, ooh baby
Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it?
Girl you're so together
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe
(Choose you babe)
Girl your smile, ooh
Is like the month of may, yeah
When you're near me
The storm clouds stay away, yeah
Even the little honey bees
Turn to you when they need more honey
Love you so much it's not funny
Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way, yeah
Oh, girl, you're so together
Oh, hey girl, girl, eye, eye, popper
A real life traffic stopper
A knock-out queen
Oh, what I mean is
Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you babe
(Girl you're so together)
Yeah
(And together we can make it all the way)
Ooh, girl, you're so together
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you,
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh
I found my happiest days,
When you came to see your grandma in may
I bumped into you by the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
(Bye, bye)
Don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget, no?
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
(Bye, bye)
Don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah
Farewell, farewell
Farewell, farewell
If you remember my name,
(Drop a line)
Drop a line sometime, yeah
Yeah, ooh
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget, no?
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
(Bye, bye)
Don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, oohh, yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell
There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me
Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me
I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me
Not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me
Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me
Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me
I can't believe that is real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you honey baby, yeah
That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me
Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Oh.. it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah...
To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame,
Not set, the pace for style
If I can follow through
on, what they gave me as my tools,
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools
If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise,
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
while growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...
(Proud)
Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Come on, come on,

On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be...

Diana Walked Up To Me,
She Said I'm All Yours
Tonight
At That I Ran To The Phone
Sayin' Baby I'm Alright
I Said But Unlock The Door,
Because I Forgot The Key,
She Said He's Not Coming

I Thought She Had To Have It
Since The First Time She Came
Who Knows The Situation
Mysteries Do Remain
And Now I Wonder Why
I Breakdown When I Cry
Is It Something I Said
Or Is It Just A Lie
(Is It Just A Lie)
I Try So Hard To Love You
Some Things Take
Time And Shame
I Think The Whole World
Of You
Your Thoughts Of Me Remain
I'll Play The Fool For You
I'll Change The Rules For You
Just Say It And I'll Do
Just Make This Thing Come True
(Make A Dream Come True)
If I Let Her Get Away

On My Knees

By Saying Let It Be
But Everytime I Did It
The Hurt Came Back At Me
I Told You That I Need You
A Thousand Times And Why
I Played The Fool For You
And Still You Said Goodbye
(Still You Said Goodbye)
If I Let Her Get Away
Then The World Will
Have To See
A Fool Who Lives Alone
And The Fool Who
Set You Free

Heal the world we live in, save it for our children
Heal the world we live in, save it for our children
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
"Boy, is that girl with you?"
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
And it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody
Girl, when the goin' gets mean
[L. T. B. rap performance]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
[Michael]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
[2x]
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, woo
I Gave Her Money
I Gave Her Time
I Gave Her Everything
Inside One Heart Could Find
I Gave Her Passion
My Very Soul
I Gave Her Promises
And Secrets So Untold
And She Promised Me Forever
And A Day We'd Live As One
We Made Our Vows
We'd Live A Life Anew
And She Promised Me In Secret
That She'd Love Me For All Time
It's A Promise So Untrue
Tell Me What Will I Do?
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seem Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
'Cause I'm Lying To Myself
And The Reason Why She Left Me
Did She Find In Someone Else?
(Who Is It?)
It Is A Friend Of Mine
(Who Is It?)
Is It My Brother!
(Who Is It?)
Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now
(Who Is It?)
I Can't Take This Stuff No More
I Am The Damned
I Am The Dead
I Am The Agony Inside
The Dying Head
This Is Injustice
Woe Unto Thee
I Pray This Punishment
Would Have Mercy On Me
And She Promised Me Forever
That We'd Live Our Life As One
We Made Our Vows
We'd Live A Love So True
It Seems That She Has Left Me
For Such Reasons Unexplained
I Need To Find The Truth
But See What Will I Do!
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seem Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure
'Cause I'm Bothered Everyday
And She Didn't Leave A Letter
She Just Up And Ran Away
(Who Is It?)
It Is A Friend Of Mine
(Who Is It?)
Is It My Brother?
(Who Is It?)
Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now
(Who Is It?)
I Can't Take It 'Cause I'm Lonely
(Who Is It?)
It Is Friend Of Mine
(Who Is It?)
To Me I'm Bothered
(Who Is It?)
Somebody Hurt My Soul, Now
(Who Is It?)
I Can't Take It 'Cause I'm Lonely
And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seen Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune
Still I Cry Alone At Night
Don't You Judge Of My Composure

She Always Takes It With A Heart Of Stone
'Cause All She Does Is Throw It Back To Me
I've Spent A Lifetime
Looking For Someone
Don't Try To Understand Me

Things I Say
Love Is A Feeling
Give It When I Want It

Quench My Desire

You Are My Friend

Weary
Tell Me Will You Hold Me
When Wrong, Will You Scold Me
When Lost Will You Find Me?
But They Told Me
A Man Should Be Faithful
And Walk When Not Able
And Fight Till The End
But I'm Only Human
Everyone's Taking Control Of Me
Seems That The World's
Got A Role For Me
I'm So Confused
Will You Show To Me

Dying With The Rising Of The Moon
Gone Too Soon
Gone Too Soon
The Way She Came Into The Place
I Knew Right Then And There
There Was Something Different
About This Girl
The Way She Moved
Her Hair, Her Face, Her Lines
Divinity In Motion
As She Stalked The Room
I Could Feel The Aura
Of Her Presence
Every Head Turned
Feeling Passion And Lust
The Girl Was Persuasive
The Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew But I Was
Walking The Line
Come Go With Me
I Said I Have No Time
And Don't You Pretend We Didn't
Talk On The Phone
My Baby Cried
She Left Me Standing Alone
She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me
She Came At Me In Sections
With The Eyes Of Desire
I Fell Trapped Into Her
Web Of Sin
A Touch, A Kiss
A Whisper Of Love
I Was At The Point
Of No Return
Deep In The Darkness Of
Passion's Insanity
I Felt Taken By Lust's
Strange Inhumanity
This Girl Was Persuasive
This Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew
But I Was Living In Vain
She Called My House
She Said You Know My Name
And Don't You Pretend
You Never Did Me Before
With Tears In Her Eyes
My Baby Walked Out The Door
She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey

Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous

I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right
You And Your Manipulation
You Hurt My Baby

She Touched Me
For The Lips Of
A Strange Woman
Drop As A Honeycomb
And Her Mouth Was
Smoother Than Oil
But Her Inner Spirit And Words
Were As Sharp As
A Two-Edged Sword
But I Loved It
'Cause It's Dangerous

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Like stranger in Moscow

"Why have you come from the West?
Confess! To steal the great achievements of the people, the accomplishments of the workers..."

[Rap: The Notorious BIG]
Listen, I've got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin'
Maybe it could be my friends
They ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer nigga I ain't jokin'
Endo smoke got me choked and I'm hopin'
The fool comes slippin'
So I could blow'em open
This time around
I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rocks
Got Pitts by the door
I've raised other peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers
So I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby

That you said we were to gain...
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son...
What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

[Verse 1:]
Money.
Money...
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it
So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust
They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money
So you go to church
Read the Holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...
If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it
You'll do anything for money...
[Chorus:]
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil
[Verse 2:]
Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
Cause your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
Of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Then watch the ones
With the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers... Cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it
You'll do anything for money...
[Chorus:]
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil
[Verse 3:]
You say you wouldn't do it
For all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man
Then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie
Then I will tell him
If you're dealing with God
Then you will hell him
You'll do anything for money
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything now
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil

Here come ol' flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He's got Joo Joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
He wear no shoe shine
He's got toe jam football
He's got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together
Right now
Over me
He bag production
He's got walrus gum-boot
He's got Ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down through his knees
Hold you in his arm 'til
You can feel his disease
Come together
Right now
Over me
Come together babe
Come together babe
Come together
Come together
He roller coaster
He's got early warning
He's got muddy water
He one Mojo filter
He say "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come together
Right now
Over me
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
you are not alone
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone...
Not alone ohh
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, Not alone
If you just reach out for me girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me not alone
Oh together together
Not not being alone
Not not being alone
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart...
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me...
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things...
It's been my fate to compensate,
for the Childhood
I've never known...
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne...
Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my Childhood?
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
for the Childhood I've never known...
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had
Have you seen my Childhood...
Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory
It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual
In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of
All your glory
It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual
Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
You're so damn disrespectable
Told me that you're doin' wrong
Word out shockin' all alone
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad
Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from a dusty hole
Tales of what somebody told
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad
Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then I'm through

He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony
A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world
Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon...
A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair...
Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...
But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...
It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there...
She knew no one cared...
Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...
Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...
If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...
If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile...
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane
Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
And Susie says its right
She got your number
How does it feel
To know this stranger
Is out to kill
She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only
Erase the past
Every night stance is like takin a chances
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
You know Susie says its right
Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
She put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
Susie says its right
It was blood on the dance floor

It was blood on the dance floor

I can't believe the things I see
Push it in stick it out
That ain't what it's all about
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me
I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aaow
There's a tappin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it
Hey!
Don't understand it
Hey.
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy
There's a tappin in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it!
Yeah Yeah!
Don't understand it!
Your just a dog gone!
Aaow!
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back,
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aaow!
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy
Aaow
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
There's a ghost out in the hall
Theirs a goul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you whose haunting me
Your warning me
To be the stranger
In your life
Am I amusing you
Or just confusing you
Am I the beast
You visualised
And if you wanna to see
Eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque
Before your eyes
Let them all materialise
Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh
Is it scary for you baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you baby
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
Their's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where restless soul's spoke
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see you
